# meetup-app-assignment

## Project details
Assignment from the third semester studying Frontend Development. The task is to build an application where you can register to attend meetups in Vue using TDD. We also had to build a Docker image and deploy it on Heroku with CI.

I chose make a meetup service for extraterrestrials modeled after meetup.com.
